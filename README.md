# Gmail Signature

![Example](example.png)

### What is this?
The HTML file in this repo generates a signature to be used in Gmail.

### How do I get my own signature?
1. Clone this repo locally
2. Edit the HTML file to your information, including replacing your headshot, name, occupation, phone number, and social media links.
3. You may want to change the links to the icons to your own icon set in case I remove them in the future (they're currently linked to my google drive). I used the icons from [this set](https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/social-network-9) at 16x16 size.
4. The headshot should be size 128x128. My head shot has about 10px of space between the top of the image and the circle, hence the text's 10px margin. You may need to change this.
5. When you are done editing the HTML, open it in the browser. Then select all and copy all.
6. Paste this into the signature box in the Gmail settings.
7. Save and send a test email to yourself.
8. Some of the CSS may get lost in the process. Go back into the signature and change the bits that got lost (usually name and job description). I am not sure why this happens but it is a common problem that I couldn't find a good solution to.
